# Advent of Guide
This is a detailed guide for solving the challenges in Advent of Code, and also a coding exercise for me. I thrive to be as clear as possible with my explanations, but in case I fail that, I have implemented a signaling form to ask questions regarding the solutions or suggest stuff to do differently.

To achieve this, I have created quite the simplistic backend to be able to manage the signals, but not much else.
